# Introduction 
It is usual in many industrialized countries to lease a car rather than buy it entirely.
A lease is a legally binding contract between a buyer and a seller (or a third party -
commonly a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution) in which the
buyer agrees to pay fixed monthly/yearly payments to the seller/financer. When the
lease time expires, the buyer has the option to purchase the vehicle at its residual
value, or estimated resale value. If the seller/financer first underestimates the
residual value, the instalments will be greater for the clients, who will almost
probably switch to another seller/financer. If the residual value is overestimated, the
clients' monthly payments will be lower, but the seller/financer may have difficulties
selling these high-priced used cars at the overestimated residual value. As a result,
we can see that calculating the price of used automobiles is also highly important for
business. German automakers lost 1 billion euros in their US market due to
incorrectly assessing the residual value of leased vehicles. As a result, to reduce the
loss on resell values.
